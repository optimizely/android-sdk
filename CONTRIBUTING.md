# Contributing to the Optimizely Android SDK

We welcome contributions and feedback! All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://docs.google.com/a/optimizely.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9cbouWptIpMgukAKZZOIAhafvjFCV8hS00XJLWQnWDFtwtA/viewform) to be eligible to contribute. Please read the [README](README.md) to set up your development environment, then read the guidelines below for information on submitting your code.

## Development process

1. Create a branch off of `master`: `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/branch_name`.
2. Commit your changes. Make sure to add tests!
3. `git push` your changes to GitHub.
4. Make sure that all unit tests are passing and that there are no merge conflicts between your branch and `master`.
5. Open a pull request from `YOUR_NAME/branch_name` to `master`.
6. A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, squash and merge it!

All branches will be built and run against the entire test suite on Travis with every commit.

The `test-app` module is built against a real Optimizely project. Changing the project ID will cause tests to fail. The test app should be used as a reference.

## Pull request acceptance criteria

* **All code must have test coverage.** We use JUnit. Changes in functionality should have accompanying unit tests. Bug fixes should have accompanying regression tests.
  * Unit tests are located in `MODULE_NAME/src/test` and instrumented tests are located in `MODULE_NAME/src/androidTest` for each module with one file per class.
* Version will be bumped automatically through Gradle after your change is merged.
* Make sure `./gradlew testAllModules` runs successfully before submitting.
